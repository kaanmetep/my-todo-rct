# TODO App - Made with React
While learning React, I'm developing a simple React todo app to both practice and keep my learned knowledge fresh.

## Features
- Users can mark tasks as completed by clicking the checkbox next to each task.
- If users click on the checkboxes of the tasks they have completed, the tasks will be reordered.
- Users can delete the tasks they have added.
- When adding a new task, you can select a priority. Options include low, medium, and high.
- If tasks are not completed, they are sorted by priority. If tasks are completed, they are placed at the end of the list with no regard to priority.

## Technologies Used

- CSS
- JavaScript
- React
